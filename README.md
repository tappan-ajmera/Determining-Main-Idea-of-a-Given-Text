__Pre-Requisite__

To run this program following are the Pre-Requisite packages

1) nltk
2) scikitlearn
4) numpy
5) scipy
6) networkx

__Running the code__

Once you have installed required packages, simply run the ExtractKeywords.py file

Input will be a text file containing passage in pure english.
The program will output the Top 5 main words in the passage.

__Example:__

We have a file name Passage.txt whose content are as follows

Compatibility of systems of linear constraints over the set of natural numbers.
Criteria of compatibility of a system of linear Diophantine equations, strict
inequations, and nonstrict inequations are considered. Upper bounds for
components of a minimal set of solutions and algorithms of construction of
minimal generating sets of solutions for all types of systems are given.
These criteria and the corresponding algorithms for constructing a minimal
supporting set of solutions can be used in solving all the considered types
systems and systems of mixed types.
